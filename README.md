# CHEM266
This repository contains several years of practice work Organic Chemistry II CHEM 266 at Southeastern Louisiana University. Specifically from the Professor known as Dr. Foite. The probablems in the book are not representative of the questions he asked you on the test. As such, the more practice with is style you have, the better. You will still have to study and practice if want to make a good grade. He rarely resuses questions, but learning the style of his questions will help you immensely.

I hope this helps someone.
